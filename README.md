# PracticeJavaScriptArray
This is a list of the JavaScript Array Functions/Methods that you can find on W3Schools JavaScript Tutorial.

Website to the JavaScript Array Tutorial is https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp

I just made a very basic index.html to display the different functions. 
For the fun I set up a Run Function button. But not all the functions are attached to the button.  
I have the functions/methods commented out so you will have to uncomment them to run them.
